# SocialEraser

SocialEraser is a tool designed to help you clean up your digital footprint by removing social media posts, likes, reposts, and other interactions across multiple platforms.

## Why SocialEraser?
I believe in **data ownership and personal control** over social media presence. Where platforms hold onto user data indefinitely, **SocialEraser** allows you to manage your online history, and remove it, with simple code snippets.

## Features
- Delete posts, comments, and likes  
- Revoke shares and reposts  
- Batch processing for efficient cleanup  
- Customizable filters for selective removal  

## Usage
TBD
